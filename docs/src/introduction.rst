Introduction
============

CHarm is a C library to work with spherical harmonics up to almost arbitrarily 
high degrees.  The library is accompanied by a Python wrapper called PyHarm.


Features
========

* Supports real-valued fully-normalized surface and solid spherical harmonics
  (the geodetic norm).

* Performs FFT-based surface spherical harmonic analysis and solid spherical
  harmonic synthesis with minimized memory requirements.

* Stable up to high degrees and orders (tens of thousands and beyond).

* Available in single, double and quadruple precision.

* Supports point and mean data values (both analysis and synthesis).

* Supports synthesis at grids and at scattered points/cells.  Grid-wise 
  computations are done by FFT whenever possible.  If FFT cannot be applied, 
  the less efficient Chebyshev recurrences are used along the latitude 
  parallels instead.

* Computes the full first- and second-order gradients at evaluation points 
  (e.g., the gravitational vector and the gravitational tensor).

* Supports the Gauss--Legendre and Driscoll--Healy quadratures.

* Integrates solid spherical harmonic expansions (e.g., of the gravitational
  potential) on band-limited irregular surfaces (e.g., on the Earth's
  surface). [#f1]_

* Computes Fourier coefficients of fully-normalized associated Legendre
  functions of the first kind up to ultra-high harmonic degrees.

* Supports SIMD parallelization on the level of a single CPU core (AVX, AVX2, 
  AVX-512 and NEON).

* Supports `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_ parallelization for
  shared-memory architectures.

* Supports `MPI <https://www.mpi-forum.org/>`_ parallelization for shared- and 
  distributed-memory architectures.

* Performs discrete FFT by `FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`_.

* Ships with a Python wrapper to enable high-level programming while retaining 
  the efficiency of the C language.  The wrapper, called PyHarm, wraps CHarm 
  using `ctypes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html>`_ and is fully 
  integrated with `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_.

.. [#f1] This routine is unique to CHarm.


Installation
============

* **PyHarm (Python wrapper)**: On Linux (x86_64), macOS (x86_64, ARM64) and 
  Windows (x86_64), install PyHarm using ``pip``:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install pyharm

  This will install PyHarm together will all the dependencies.  These include 
  a pre-compiled CHarm library, which is internally called by PyHarm, some 
  other C libraries (FFTW and GOMP) and the Python package NumPy.

* **CHarm (C library)**: If you are interested in the C API, you have to build 
  CHarm from source.  This step is not required if you plan to use the Python 
  interface only.

Documentation
=============

The documentation of the latest version from the ``master`` branch is available 
at `https://www.charmlib.org <https://www.charmlib.org>`_.

A pre-compiled HTML documentation is also available in ``docs/build/html``.  
Alternatively, it can be built by executing ``make html`` after the 
``configure`` call (requires ``--enable-python``, ``--enable-mpi``, ``doxygen`` 
and Python modules ``sphinx``, ``sphinx_book_theme`` and ``breathe``).  Other 
formats of the documentation, for instance, a PDF file, can be built with ``cd 
docs && make latexpdf``, etc.  To list all available formats, execute ``cd docs 
&& make help``.

Pronunciation
=============

We prefer to pronounce CHarm and PyHarm like the words ``see harm`` and ``pie 
harm``.  But it is indeed quite charming to pronounce CHarm like the word 
``charm``, especially when the library works like a charm.
