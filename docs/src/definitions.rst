.. _points_cells:

Evaluation points and evaluation cells
======================================

CHarm can work with evaluation points and evaluation cells.

* An evaluation **point** is given by the spherical latitude, :math:`\varphi
  \in [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]`, the spherical longitude, :math:`\lambda
  \in [0, 2\pi)`, and the spherical radius, :math:`r > 0`.

* An evaluation **cell** is given the minimum and the maximum latitude,
  :math:`\varphi^{\mathrm{min}}` and :math:`\varphi^{\mathrm{max}}`,
  respectively, the minimum and the maximum longitude,
  :math:`\lambda^{\mathrm{min}}` and :math:`\lambda^{\mathrm{max}}`,
  respectively, and a *single* spherical radius :math:`r` that is *constant*
  over the cell.

Occasionally, spherical co-latitude, :math:`\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} - \varphi`,
:math:`\theta \in [0, \pi]`, will be used instead of the spherical latitude.

.. note::
   Angular inputs/outputs (if any) must always be provided in radians in CHarm.

Evaluation points/cells can either be organized as a grid or as scattered
points/cells.

* **Grid of points** is defined by

  * ``nlat`` latitudes over a single grid meridian,

  * ``nlon`` longitudes over a single grid latitude parallel, and

  * ``nlat`` spherical radii over a single grid meridian.

  The grid has in total ``nlat * nlon`` points.  The spherical radius ``r`` may
  vary with the latitude, but is implicitly considered to be constant in the
  longitudinal direction (hence the ``nlat`` number of radii).

  CHarm does not store all ``nlat * nlon`` grid coordinates, but only the grid
  boundaries to save some memory.

* **Grid of cells** is defined by

  * ``nlat`` minimum cell latitudes over a single grid meridian,

  * ``nlat`` maximum cell latitudes over a single grid meridian,

  * ``nlon`` minimum longitudes over a single grid latitude parallel,

  * ``nlon`` maximum longitudes over a single grid latitude parallel, and

  * ``nlat`` spherical radii over a single grid meridian.

  The grid has in total ``nlat * nlon`` cells.  Given that the spherical radius 
  (1) is implicitly constant over a grid cell and (2) may vary only with 
  latitude, there is ``nlat`` spherical radii.

  Again, CHarm stores only the grid boundaries.

* **Scattered points** are defined by

  * ``nlat == nlon`` latitudes,

  * ``nlat == nlon`` longitudes, and

  * ``nlat == nlon`` spherical radii.

  The total number of scattered points is ``nlat == nlon``.

* **Scattered cells** are defined by

  * ``nlat == nlon`` minimum latitudes,

  * ``nlat == nlon`` maximum latitudes,

  * ``nlat == nlon`` minimum longitudes,

  * ``nlat == nlon`` maximum longitudes,

  * ``nlat == nlon`` spherical radii.

  The total number of scattered cells is ``nlat == nlon``.

.. note::

   Routines implementing the definitions of evaluation points/cells are
   gathered in :ref:`charm_crd` and :ref:`pyharm_crd`.


Symmetric grids
---------------

In CHarm, grid-wise computations are most efficient when the grids are 
symmetric with respect to the equator.  CHarm then takes advantage of the 
equatorial symmetry of Legendre functions and thus improves the computation 
speed.

With scattered points/cells, CHarm never applies the symmetry property of 
Legendre functions.

Symmetric point grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are some examples of **symmetric** point grids.  Shown are only latitudes, 
as longitudes do not affect the equatorial grid symmetry.  The units are 
degrees for a more intuitive understanding but the function inputs are always 
in radians.

- Equator included:

  .. code-block:: none

       -90.0, -60.0, -30.0, 0.0, 30.0, 60.0, 90.0

  or

  .. code-block:: none

       -80.0, -60.0, -40.0, -20.0, 0.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0

- Equator excluded:

  .. code-block:: none

       -35.0, -25.0, -15.0, -5.0, 5.0, 15.0, 25.0, 35.0

  or

  .. code-block:: none

       -90.0, -85.0, -80.0, 80.0, 85.0, 90.0

- Varying spacing, equator excluded:

  .. code-block:: none

       -90.0, -80.0, -75.0, -70.0, -69.0, 69.0, 70.0, 75.0, 80.0, 90.0

Now some **non-symmetric** point grids:

- The negative latitude of ``-90.0 deg`` does not have its positive
  counterpart:

  .. code-block:: none

       -90.0, -60.0, -30.0, 0.0, 30.0, 60.0

- The relative difference between ``fabs(-4.99)`` and ``fabs(5.0)`` is
  larger than the CHarm's internal threshold limit (see :ref:`charm_glob`):

  .. code-block:: none

       -35.0, -25.0, -15.0, -4.99, 5.0, 15.0, 25.0, 35.0

- This one is obviosly not symmetric:

  .. code-block:: none

        80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 25, 20, 15

- Any grid with one latitude parallel only:

  .. code-block:: none

        45

  or

  .. code-block:: none

        0


In other words, the grid is symmetric in the latitudinal direction,
provided that all positive latitudes have their negative counterparts at
the right places.  The zero latitude, i.e., the equator, may be present in the 
grid.


Symmetric grids of cells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A *symmetric* grid of cells could look like (shown are only the minimum and the 
maximum cell latitudes ``latmin`` and ``latmax``, respectively):

.. code-block:: none

           latmin: -90.0, -60.0, -30.0,  0.0, 30.0, 60.0
           latmax: -60.0, -30.0,   0.0, 30.0, 60.0, 90.0

.. code-block:: none

           latmin: -35.0, -25.0, -15.0, -5.0,  5.0, 15.0, 25.0
           latmax: -25.0, -15.0,  -5.0,  5.0, 15.0, 25.0, 35.0

.. code-block:: none

           latmin: -90.0, -85.0, 80.0, 85.0
           latmax: -85.0, -80.0, 85.0, 90.0

.. code-block:: none

           latmin: -90.0, -80.0, -75.0, -70.0, 69.0, 70.0, 75.0, 80.0
           latmax: -80.0, -75.0, -70.0, -69.0, 70.0, 75.0, 80.0, 90.0

Next follow some *non-symmetric* grid of cells:

.. code-block:: none

           latmin: -90.0, -60.0, -30.0,  0.0, 30.0
           latmax: -60.0, -30.0,   0.0, 30.0, 60.0

.. code-block:: none

           latmin: -35.0, -25.0, -15.0,     5.0, 15.0, 25.0
           latmax: -25.0, -15.0,  -4.99,   15.0, 25.0, 35.0




Surface spherical harmonics
===========================

Real-valued surface spherical harmonics :math:`\bar{Y}_{nm}(\varphi, \lambda)`
of degree :math:`n` and order :math:`m` are defined as (e.g., Hofmann-Wellenhof
and Moritz, 2005)

.. math::
   \bar{Y}_{nm}(\varphi, \lambda) = \bar{P}_{nm}(\sin \varphi)
   \begin{cases}
   \cos(m\, \lambda){,}\\
   \sin(m\, \lambda){.}
   \end{cases}

Here,

.. math::
   \bar{P}_{nm}(\sin \varphi) =
   \begin{cases}
   \sqrt{(2n + 1)} \, P_n(\sin\varphi){,} &m = 0 {,}\\
   \sqrt{2 (2n + 1) \dfrac{(n - m)!}{(n + m)!}} \, \left(1 -
   \sin^2\varphi\right)^{m / 2} \, \dfrac{\mathrm{d}^m
   P_n(\sin\varphi)}{\mathrm{d} (\sin\varphi)^m} {,} \quad &0 < m \leq n {,}
   \end{cases}

are the fully-normalized associated Legendre functions of the first kind and

.. math::
   P_n(\sin\varphi) = \dfrac{1}{2^n \, n!} \, \dfrac{\mathrm{d}^n}{\mathrm{d}
   (\sin\varphi)^n} \left(\sin^2\varphi - 1 \right)^n

are the (un-normalized) Legendre polynomials (:math:`m = 0`, so the order is
omitted from the notation).

.. warning::
   CHarm evaluates the latitudinal derivatives of Legendre functions by the 
   fixed-order recurrences from Appendix A.1 of Fukushima (2012b), which are 
   *singular* at the poles.

.. note::
   Applied is the geodetic :math:`4\pi` full normalization.  Neither other
   normalizations nor complex spherical harmonics are supported (yet?).

.. note::
   The numerical evaluation of Legendre functions is performed after Fukushima
   (2012a), so spherical harmonics can be safely evaluated up to high degrees
   and orders (tens of thousands and even well beyond).


Spherical harmonic analysis
===========================

Assume a harmonic function :math:`f(r, \varphi, \lambda)` given on a sphere
with the radius :math:`r`.  By surface spherical harmonic analysis,

.. math::
   \left.\begin{aligned}
   \bar{C}_{nm} \\
   \bar{S}_{nm}
   \end{aligned}\right\}
   = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi} \, \dfrac{R}{\mu} \, \left( \dfrac{r}{R} \right)^n
   \displaystyle\iint_{\sigma} f(r, \varphi, \lambda) \,
   \bar{Y}_{nm}(\varphi,\lambda) \, \mathrm{d}\sigma {,}

it is possible to compute its spherical harmonic coefficients
:math:`\{ \bar{C}_{nm},\, \bar{S}_{nm} \}`.  The coefficients are normalized by
the :math:`\mu` constant and, if :math:`r \neq R`, they are
additionally rescaled **from** the data sphere with the radius :math:`r` **to**
the reference sphere with the radius :math:`R`.

* If :math:`r = R = \mu = 1`, one arrives at the surface spherical harmonic
  analysis that is well-known from the literature.

* If :math:`r = R`, then :math:`f` does not even have to be harmonic.

* In geosciences, :math:`\mu` frequently represents the geocentric
  gravitational constant and :math:`R` stands for the equatorial radius of the
  Earth.

If :math:`f` is band-limited (that is, it has a finite spherical harmonic
expansion) and is sampled at suitable grid points, these equations can be
computed rigorously (analytically).  Examples of such quadrature, employed in
CHarm, are the Gauss--Legendre quadrature (Sneeuw, 1994) and the
Driscoll--Healy quadrature (Driscoll and Healy, 1994).

In CHarm, the coefficients can also be computed from mean values
:math:`\tilde{f}` of :math:`f` given over grid cells.  In that case, however,
the quadratures are no longer exact.

.. note::

   Routines for spherical harmonic analysis are gathered in
   :ref:`charm_sha` and :ref:`pyharm_sha`.


Spherical harmonic synthesis
============================

Assume that surface spherical harmonic coefficients :math:`\{ \bar{C}_{nm},\,
\bar{S}_{nm} \}` of a harmonic function :math:`f(r, \varphi,\lambda)` are
available up to degree :math:`n_{\mathrm{max}}` and are scaled to a constant
:math:`\mu` and a reference sphere with the radius :math:`R`.  Then, it is
possible to reconstruct a point value of :math:`f(r, \varphi,\lambda)` for any
:math:`(r > R, \varphi,\lambda)` *exactly* by solid spherical harmonic
synthesis,

.. math::

   \displaystyle f(r, \varphi,\lambda) = \frac{\mu}{R} \, \sum_{n
   = 0}^{n_{\max}} \left( \frac{R}{r} \right)^{n + 1} \, \sum_{m = 0}^{n}
   \left( \bar{C}_{nm}\, \cos(m \, \lambda) + \bar{S}_{nm} \, \sin(m \,
   \lambda) \right) \, \bar{P}_{nm}(\sin\varphi){.}

If the evaluation points :math:`(r, \varphi,\lambda)` form a grid (as defined
in :ref:`points_cells`), highly efficient FFT-based algorithms can be employed
(e.g., Colombo, 1981; Sneeuw, 1994; Jekeli et al, 2007; Rexer and Hirt, 2015).
CHarm takes advantage of these algorithms in order to achieve efficient
grid-wise numerical computations.

In addition to point values of :math:`f`, CHarm computes also mean values of
:math:`f` over cells (as defined in :ref:`points_cells`):

.. math::

   \displaystyle \tilde{f}(r, \varphi_{\mathrm{min}},\varphi_{\mathrm{max}},
   \lambda_{\mathrm{min}},\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}) = \frac{1}{\Delta \sigma}
   \int\limits_{\varphi = \varphi_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\varphi_{\mathrm{max}}}
   \int\limits_{\lambda = \lambda_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}} f(r,
   \varphi,\lambda) \, \mathrm{d}\lambda \, \cos\varphi \, \mathrm{d} \varphi

and

.. math::

   \displaystyle \tilde{f}(r(\varphi, \lambda), \varphi_{\mathrm{min}},
   \varphi_{\mathrm{max}}, \lambda_{\mathrm{min}},\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}) =&
   \frac{1}{\Delta \sigma} \int\limits_{\varphi
   = \varphi_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\varphi_{\mathrm{max}}} \int\limits_{\lambda
   = \lambda_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}} f(r(\varphi,\lambda),
   \varphi,\lambda) \\
   &\times \mathrm{d}\lambda \, \cos\varphi \, \mathrm{d} \varphi {,}

where :math:`\Delta\sigma` is the size of the cell on the unit sphere.

Note that in the latter equation, :math:`f(r(\varphi,\lambda),\varphi,\lambda)`
is defined on an irregular surface given by a spherical radius
:math:`r(\varphi,\lambda)` that varies with the latitude and longitude.  This
computation is unique to CHarm and cannot be found in any other publicly
available package or library.

.. note::

   Routines for spherical harmonic synthesis are gathered in
   :ref:`charm_shs` and :ref:`pyharm_shs`.


.. _lnof:

Local north-oriented reference frame
====================================

Local north-oriented reference frame (LNOF) is the right-handed Cartesian 
coordinate system defined as follows: the origin is at the evaluation point 
:math:`P(r, \varphi, \lambda)`, the :math:`x`-axis points to the north, the 
:math:`y`-axis points to the west and the :math:`z`-axis points radially 
outwards.  At :math:`P(r, \varphi, \lambda)`, the :math:`xy` plane is 
tangential to the sphere with the radius :math:`r` passing through :math:`P(r, 
\varphi, \lambda)`.
