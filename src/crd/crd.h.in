 *
 *   - ``latmin`` and ``latmax`` must each have access to ``nlat`` elements,
 *
 *   - ``lonmin`` and ``lonmax`` must each have access to ``nlon`` elements,
 *
 *   - ``r`` must have access to ``nlat`` elements.
 *
 * @note See ``charm@P@_crd_cell_malloc()`` to find out how to access the
 * coordinates stored in the returned ``charm@P@_cell`` structure.
 *
 * @note See ``charm@P@_shc_init()`` for the rationale behind the shallow
 * copies of input arrays ``latmin``, ``latmax``, ``lonmin``, ``lonmax`` and
 * ``r``. The memory of these arrays must be treated in the same fashion as
 * shown therein with the ``c`` and ``s`` arrays.
 *
 * @warning The structure created by this function *must* be deallocated using
 * ``charm@P@_crd_cell_free()``. The usual deallocation with ``free`` will lead
 * to memory leaks.
 *
 * @returns On success, returned is a pointer to the ``charm@P@_cell``
 * structure. On error, ``NULL`` is returned. Errors include memory allocation
 * failures and incorrect input arguments (e.g., ``nlat < 1``, ``nlon < 1`` or
 * unsupported value of ``type``).
