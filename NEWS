Upcoming release:

* Fixed outside-of-bounds reads bug in the spherical harmonic synthesis at 
  Driscoll--Healy grids.  The outputs of the synthesis were correct but various 
  errors might occur rarely (e.g., segmentation fault).

* Removed variable-length arrays from one specific internal routine of CHarm.  
  CHarm is now completely free from variable-length arrays.

* Functions returning NaN now use the `NAN` macro from `math.h`.  
  Previously, `0.0 / 0.0` was used to get NaN.  Now this is only a fallback if 
  the `NAN` macro is not found in `math.h`.

* The internal parameter `SIMD_BLOCK` is now set to `4` for all kinds of AVX 
  instruction sets.  This value seems to perform the best overall.

* Changed PyHarm building process.  The C-part of PyHarm is now compiled from 
  within Python as an extension module.

* Lib names no longer have the `_omp` suffix, even if CHarm is compiled 
  with OpenMP support.  Depending on the precision, the names are `libcharmf`, 
  `libcharm` and `libcharmq`.  This affects the way how CHarm is linked.

CHarm 0.4.0:

This release adds new functions to synthesize the full first- and second-order 
gradients in the local north-oriented reference frame (LNOF) at evaluation 
points.  The API is backward compatible except for a minor change in the `misc` 
module.

* Added functions to compute point values of the full first- and second-order 
  gradients in LNOF and of the first- and second-order derivatives with respect 
  to the spherical coordinates.

  In CHarm, the new functions are placed in the `shs` module:

    * `charm_shs_point_grad1` (the full first-order gradient in LNOF),
    * `charm_shs_point_grad2` (the full second-order gradient in LNOF),
    * `charm_shs_point_guru` (guru interface for first- and second-order 
                              derivatives with respect to the spherical 
                              coordinates).

  In PyHarm, the new functions are:

    * `pyharm.shs.point_grad1`,
    * `pyharm.shs.point_grad2`,
    * `pyharm.shs.point_guru`.

  Example codes are provided in the cookbook.

* Added members `npoint` and `ncell` to the `charm_point` and `charm_cell` 
  structures, respectively.  The new members represent the total number of 
  points/cells stored by the structures both for scattered points/cells and 
  grids.  They are particularly useful when allocating the memory for the 
  signal to be synthesized at the points/cells represented by the structures.

* Values

    * `CHARM_SHC_NMAX_MODEL`
    * `CHARM_SHC_NMAX_ERROR`

  are now symbolic constants instead of enumerations.  This is because ISO 
  C restricts enumerator values to the range of `int`, but we need the maximum 
  values of `unsigned long`.  The latter thus do not fall within the range that 
  can be portably stored by enumerations.

* Renamed

    * `charm_misc_print_version`

  to

    * `charm_misc_print_info`

  which better describes its purpose.  Now it also prints various kind of 
  useful user-defined compilation flags (`CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`, etc).

* Added functions `charm_misc_get_version` to return a string specifying the 
  CHarm version number determined on compilation time.

* Added function `charm_misc_buildopt_version_fftw` that returns a string 
  specifying the FFTW version that was used to compile CHarm.

* Changed value of the internal parameter `SIMD_BLOCK` from `8` to `2`.  On 
  some recent processors, this may improve the performance up to 40 %, while no 
  significant deteriorations was encountered on older CPUs.  In the future, it 
  would be nice to tune this parameter for the host's CPU during compilation.

CHarm 0.3.1:

* Added support to read the ICGEM's time variable gravity field models.  
  Supported are both the `icgem1.0` and `icgem2.0` formats.

* Added support to get the maximum harmonic degree of coefficients from data 
  files without the need to initialize a `charm_shc` structure.  In CHarm, this 
  can be done using the functions to read spherical harmonic coefficients from 
  data files.  In PyHarm, a new method `nmax_from_file` was added to the `Shc` 
  class to this end.

* Added support to read and write spherical harmonic coefficients in the `dov` 
  text format (degree, order, value).

* PyHarm functions to read spherical harmonic coefficients

    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.from_file_gfc`,
    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.from_file_tbl`,
    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.from_file_bin`,
    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.from_file_mtx`

  were merged into a single function

    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.from_file`.

  PyHarm functions to write spherical harmonic coefficients

    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.to_file_tbl`,
    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.to_file_bin`,
    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.to_file_mtx`

  were merged into a single function

    * `pyharm.shc.Shc.to_file`.

* Renamed symbolic constants

    * `CHARM_SHC_WRITE_TBL_N`,
    * `CHARM_SHC_WRITE_TBL_M`,

  to

    * `CHARM_SHC_WRITE_N`,
    * `CHARM_SHC_WRITE_M`,

  so that both can be used with the `tbl` and `dov` formats.

CHarm 0.3.0:

This release significantly improves performance of point synthesis and 
analysis, fixes a few bugs and makes a few modifications of the API.

* Fixed memory leak in `charm_integ_pn1m1pn2m2`.

* Renamed symbolic constants

    * `CHARM_LEG_PNMJ_ORDER_MNJ`,
    * `CHARM_LEG_PNMJ_ORDER_MJN`

  to

    * `CHARM_LEG_PMNJ`,
    * `CHARM_LEG_PMJN`,

  respectively.

* Removed the `xnum` module from the public API.  It offered only little added 
  value, as all its functions are easy to implement.  This makes the API 
  cleaner, especially in long terms, given that much more interesting modules 
  are yet to come.

* The function `charm_leg_pnmj_length` was removed from the API.  The number of 
  coefficients stored in the `charm_pnmj` structure is already provided in its 
  `npnmj` member.

* Added functions to check various features of CHarm that are determined during 
  the compilation time:

    * `charm_misc_buildopt_precision`,
    * `charm_misc_buildopt_omp_charm`,
    * `charm_misc_buildopt_omp_fftw`,
    * `charm_misc_buildopt_simd`,
    * `charm_misc_buildopt_isfinite`.

* Switched to `sphinx_book_theme` for html docs.

* Added support for polar optimization to increase computational speed
  (Eqs. 7 and 8 of Reinecke and Seljebotn 2013).  As long as the polar
  optimization parameters (see the `glob` module) are chosen appropriately,
  this technique improves the performance and still keeps an excellent
  accuracy.  However, unwisely chosen tuning parameters may negatively affect
  the output accuracy.

  By default, the polar optimization is turned off.

* Improved caching for point synthesis and analysis by the blocking technique.  
  No effort has yet been made to apply the cache blocking also for cell 
  analysis and synthesis, which therefore offer a sub-optimal implementation.  
  This might change in the future if the performance of cell transforms becomes 
  an issue or a limitation.

* Added automatic dynamical switching to the computation of Legendre functions 
  (Fukushima, 2016).

* Added dynamic scheduling to parallel for loops in shs.  This slightly 
  improves the performance, because the computation time of Legendre functions 
  varies across the meridian (mainly due to X-numbers, dynamical switching and, 
  if applied, polar optimization).  In sha, the dynamic scheduling has been in 
  use right from the beginning.

* Introduced `NEG_R` macro to properly switch the sign of SIMD vectors.

* Improved test suite.  The functions are now smaller and cleaner.  Some new 
  tests were also added, mostly to check various custom allocation functions.

* New benchmarks are available at 
  https://www.charmlib.org/build/html/benchmarks.html.

CHarm 0.2.0:

* Added Python wrapper called PyHarm.  This step necessitated several 
  modifications of the CHarm API, some of which are not backward compatible.  
  The changes are listed below.

* The `charm_crd` structure was replaced by new structures:

    * `charm_point` and
    * `charm_cell`,

  which distinguish between evaluation points and evaluation cells.

* Functions:

    * `charm_shc_init`,
    * `charm_crd_init`,
    * `charm_leg_pnmj_init`

  were replaced by

    * `charm_shc_calloc`,
    * `charm_crd_calloc`,
    * `charm_leg_pnmj_calloc`.

  The new functions behave in the same fashion as the old ones, including their 
  interface.

  The following functions have been added:

    * `charm_shc_malloc`,
    * `charm_crd_malloc`,
    * `charm_leg_pnmj_malloc`,

  which behave similarly as their `*_calloc` counterparts, but provide 
  uninitialized memory.

  Functions:

    * `charm_shc_init`,
    * `charm_crd_init`

  have now a different meaning.  They can be used to create the respective 
  structures from data arrays provided by the user.

* Changed API of the following functions to read/write spherical harmonic 
  coefficients from/to files:

    * `charm_shc_read_bin`,
    * `charm_shc_read_gfc`,
    * `charm_shc_read_mtx`,
    * `charm_shc_read_tbl`,
    * `charm_shc_write_bin`,
    * `charm_shc_write_mtx`,
    * `charm_shc_write_tbl`.

  Previously, it was necessary to open the stream for the input/output file, 
  call the CHarm function to read/write the coefficients and, finally, close 
  the stream.  All these steps had to be done by the user.  Now, the user only 
  calls the function to read/write the coefficients and specifies the file's 
  path name as one of the input parameters.  Opening and closing the stream is 
  done by CHarm.

  This should considerably simplify making the Python wrapper, given than 
  wrapping `TYPE *` pointer with `ctypes` is not that trivial.

* Symbolic constants `CHARM_CRD_CELLS_*` and `CHARM_CRD_POINTS_*` were renamed 
  to `CHARM_CRD_CELL_*` and `CHARM_CRD_POINT_*`.

* The `nmj_order` member of `charm_pnmj` was renamed to `ordering`.

* Bug fix for `integ_pn1m1pn2m2`.  The routine now works correctly with both 
  ordering schemes of Fourier coefficients of Legendre functions.

* Bug fix for `shc_read_bin`.  The function no longer throws an error when 
  reading coefficients up to a maximum degree that is lower than the one in the 
  binary file.

* Fix a few leg_pnmj tests that did not actually run.

* Fixed use-after-free bug in degree amplitude tests.

* Two members, `nc` and `ns`, were added to the `charm_shc` structure to 
  represent the total number of spherical harmonic coefficients `Cnm` and 
  `Snm`, respectively.  This does not break the previous API.

* Added support for Fortran's `D` and `d` decimal exponents when reading from 
  text files.

* Compiling CHarm as a shared library is no longer disabled by default.

* The documentation can now be build with `make html` instead of `make docs`.

CHarm 0.1.2:

* Bug fix for incorrectly included c-file instead of its respective header file 
  in `integ_cc.c`.  The bug was introduced in CHarm 0.1.0.

CHarm 0.1.1:

* A few typo fixes in docs on installing.

CHarm 0.1.0:

* Added support for AVX, AVX2 and AVX-512 vector CPU instructions.

* Bug fix in synthesis of point/mean values at grids having only a single 
  point/cell in the longitudinal direction (`shs_point_grd.c`, 
  `shs_cell_grd.c`).  The same bug fix applies to the analysis of area-mean 
  values (`sha_cell.c`) and the synthesis of area-mean values on irregular 
  surfaces (`shs_cell_isurf.c`).  Each of the routines returned an error before 
  the computation could start.

* Removed some functions from API that bring little added value to the users 
  (`charm_misc_is_nearly_equal`, `charm_misc_arr_min`, `charm_misc_arr_max`, 
  `charm_misc_arr_mean`, `charm_misc_arr_std`, `charm_misc_arr_rms`, 
  `charm_misc_arr_chck_lin_incr` and `charm_misc_arr_chck_symm`).

CHarm 0.0.1:

* Fixed data-sharing bug in `shs_cell_isurf_coeffs.c`.

CHarm 0.0.0:

* Initial release
